#Week 2 - Class 3
##Homework
* Setup your cells with Auto Layout so you can see the entire tweet's text. If you get any `...` at the end that is probably twitters API being annoying.
* Create a 2nd UIViewController that shows an individual tweet in detail
* Upon clicking a tweet, your interface should push to the 2nd UIViewController and display the tweet's details, but with a few caveats:
  * If the tweet that was selected is a retweet, you should let the user know in some way.
  * This information is available in the JSON, you just have to go digging for it and add a property to your Tweet class.
* Create a ProfileViewController that when presented, shows the logged in user's profile information. Utilize the NavigationBar to add a button to present this new viewController.
